## My process

I am re-doing all the learning path challenges using tailwindcss. Rather than trying to translate my original design into tailwind, I started from scratch (which is always the best way to redo a challenge.)

I downloaded the starter files, checked out the style guide, and made a set of custom colors. I then researched tailwindcss.com to find out, for example, what tailwindcss calls "font weight 600" (font-semibold).

Then I looked at the figma file to see what styles go where from the style sheet. I made a few notes; I blocked out the layout and decided what to apply to each block (flexbox, grid, etc).

Then I went to the html and marked it up.

Next, it was time to install tailwind in the project via package manager. Time to to start styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I really liked the challenge (except for the color palette which made me want to puke), because the last challenge involved a bit of grid, and I was ready to do a whole tailwind grid layout. What I learned was to carefully examine the design files before coding. I finished the desktop version only to realize that the order of the cards is not the same in the mobile and desktop version! I had to scrap the whole thing and start again from the top.

### Continued development

I was unable to correctly position the background image in tailwindcss with the offset; will need to do more research on tailwindcss background images.
